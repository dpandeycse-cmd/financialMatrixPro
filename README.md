# Advanced Pie Chart (Power BI Custom Visual)

Advanced Pie Chart is a Power BI custom visual that renders a pie/donut chart with configurable labels, legend placement, and interactions.

## Compliance notes (Marketplace/AppSource)

- No telemetry: the visual does not send usage analytics or tracking events.
- No external network calls: the visual does not call external APIs.
- Data handling: all rendering is performed in-memory using the data provided by Power BI; the visual does not store report data in persistent browser storage.
